A SIGCHI Local Chapter is one of the ways a local HCI community can organize and get visibility and support for their activities. However, many active volunteers in this field might not be aware of this possibility. The main goal of the Chapters’ SIG in CHI’15 is to inform interested parties of SIGCHI Local Chapters and to find ways in which SIGCHI could better support local HCI communities with their various needs all over the world.","WARNING: Reference 6 is very long.

This research SIG will bring together female and male academics, industry researchers, and practitioners with three goals in mind: (1) to build community across research/practice boundaries; (2) to pool our knowledge on promising practices for design and evaluation of software from a gender perspective; and (3) to begin to build a shared, on-line research and literature base to support solid, well-informed progress on this important issue.","WARNING: These references are very long: 7, 24.
