Such patterns of interaction in ‘mobile lives’ pose new opportunities and challenges for people and societies. We argue that design-led inquiry has a potentially transformative role to play in addressing these opportunities and challenges of mobile living and working, in future HCI research. This workshop aims to bring together design researchers and practitioners in an effort to critically explore the use of design-led inquiry within HCI research on mobile lives, for conceptual and empirical investigation, and for forms of stakeholder and partner engagement.","1.

The development of these “smart home technologies” have been investigated by diverse fields spanning technical, sociological, and health-oriented disciplines, attempting to meet varying users’ needs from technology savvy, “mass market”, and functionally declining older adult populations. In an effort to promote human-centred knowledge exchange and design expertise between these communities, this workshop aims to explore interaction design for intended smart home users at and transitioning between successive life stages. Ultimately, we will aim to address how smart home technologies can be designed to evolve with their users over the life course. By uniting researchers and designers from various backgrounds, we hope to stimulate both actionable insights and design artifacts that better capture the evolutionary nature of users and their home contexts, which participants can then apply in their own research and design work going forward.","1.

However, when it comes to designing technologies, this binary is still frequently invoked. In this workshop, our goal is to address what issues arise when we invoke this binary uncritically, and how we can better understand people’s everyday experiences of their on- and offline self-representations and interactions. When, how and why do people invoke or exploit notions of online versus offline? When does this notional ‘seam’ dissolve? We will articulate a broadened agenda for understanding behavior across contexts. We aim to continue and update discussions of on- and offline with a deeper focus on people’s practices and experiences around the creation and maintenance of a sense of ‘self’ and identity and discuss designers’ and developers’ roles and responsibilities in enabling and supporting those practices.","1. boyd, d., Ellison, N.B. 2007.

The Executive and the chairs of the upcoming conferences accepted these recommendations. In this proposal we set out how we will attract and select appropriate artworks for the CH2015 workshop, and how we will run the workshop to explore the themes that the art works raise. Additionally we will discuss how we will involve South Korean partners to highlight local culture and impacts of South Korean interactive artists and provide opportunities for deep cross-cultural dialogs.

However, a concrete framework for synergizing the capabilities of humans and technologies to allow fully engaging interactions to happen is yet to be developed. We posit that such a framework should be grounded in a deeper understanding of human nature (e.g., mind-body relations), which in the field of HCI has primarily been built upon the Western philosophies.  There are scattered, underexplored Eastern philosophies (e.g., Yijing, Zen) that may provide new lens and tools to analyze how humans interact with resources in their environments, including technological artefacts. Discussions of leveraging and possibly integrating Eastern and Western insights for human engagement studies will be an exciting and a radical forum for the HCI community.","WARNING: Reference 10 is very long.

First it asks how HCI researchers think about the research challenges they tackle: how do they decide what problems to engage with and how to study them? Second, the question also asks what is the subject of HCI: which challenges should researchers address and, ultimately, what makes us unique as a discipline? While there have been intermittent discussions on this topic in HCI, the present workshop emphasizes this question and explore some possible answers among a group of seasoned researchers. One reason is our belief that researchers can benefit from addressing these questions so as to develop their practical understanding (e.g., “tricks of the trade”) of how to tackle the complexity of selecting “what to study”. Second, we argue that researchers can benefit from thinking about the epistemological grounds upon which they base their everyday work, that is, thinking about what HCI is. The workshop results in publicly available key readings and position papers on “What to Study in HCI”.","1. Campbell, J.P., Daft, R.L., Hulin, C.L., Association, A.P., and others.

Research on mobile collocated interactions has been looking at situations in which collocated users engage in collaborative activities using their mobile devices, thus going from personal/individual toward shared/multiuser experiences and interactions. However, computers are getting smaller, more powerful, and closer to our bodies. Therefore, mobile collocated interactions research, which originally looked at smartphones and tablets, will inevitably include ever-smaller computers, ones that can be worn on our wrists or other parts of the body. The focus of this workshop is to bring together a community of researchers, designers and practitioners to explore the potential of extending mobile collocated interactions to the use of wearable devices.","1.

Three opportunities/challenges are presenting themselves: The disappearing computer is putting embodiment back in the center of our concerns; intelligent agents are reaching a level of complexity, where it is feasible for an interface to provide suggestions based on your own work practices; and finally, creative work is increasingly done in collaboration reminiscent of the classic image of musicians playing in a group.

New technologies are now being designed and evaluated in settings that involve vulnerable or marginalized participants and that can be emotionally challenging for researchers. Research in these settings can produce complex ethical dilemmas that are often emergent, diverse, and highly contextualized. In addition, there may be discrepancies between the realities of HCI fieldwork and the formal and often rigid processes of obtaining ethics approval in research institutions. Given these issues, it is important for researchers to communally reflect on ethical encounters in HCI research. This workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share experiences about ethical challenges they have faced. These discussions will be used to develop a handbook of practical lessons representing the breadth and depth of ethical issues emerging in HCI research in sensitive settings.","1. Branham, S., et al.

However, play could be more broadly beneficial for all children and their wellbeing.

We hope to engage in setting a new agenda for our research community through the identification, collection, and presentation of text entry edge cases. As such, our workshop has two specific foci. First, to strengthen the text entry community by bringing text entry researchers working in various disciplines together in hopes of sharing knowledge across disciplines and establishing a set of best practices that can be used to build our community. Second, to set a research agenda around these edge cases that can be used to drive the field forwards and unite the field in a common direction so that our combined efforts can help bring novel and impactful text entry solutions to new and emerging technologies as well as underserved communities of users and research domains.","1.

This workshop covers the crossover between driving/riding in (semi-) autonomous vehicles and user experience (UX) research. The focus lies in an in-depth discussion on challenges and potentials for UX in autonomous vehicles. We will explore various areas such as, user experience factors, interaction design issues, entertainment potentials, social driving, and methodological issues. Additionally, we envision building a bridge between the automotive community and the human-robot-interaction community, since we believe autonomous vehicles can be regarded as a very specific kind of a robot. The overall aim of the workshop is to discuss the future landscape for research within and across each of these areas.","1. Bishop, R (2005). Intelligent Vehicle Technologies and Trends.

Historically, as a Japanese term, the origin of the  concept of “Kansei“ goes back to “Aesthesis” by Aristotle and “Aesthetics” concepts by Baumgarten and Kant. When this concept was imported to Japan in Meiji era, about 150 years ago, the concept was translated as “Bigaku” or the science of beauty as well as was translated as “Kansei” or the concept with the connotation including sensitivity, sensibility, emotion and feeling. Hence Kansei is related to the science of beauty in its historical background in Japan. JSKE (Japan Society of Kansei Engineering) started a series of KEER (Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research) conference in the latter sense of aesthetics. This is a peculiar situation of the Japanese language and its academic culture. Similarly, The term “Kansei“ can be interpreted differently from country to country, and from culture to culture. \ This workshop is organized to discuss the concept of “Kansei” from different cultural perspectives. For example, “kawaii” is now used internationally as can be found in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii). At the same time, this workshop aims not only to differentiate the differences among various cultures, but also expects to find out the common aspects based on the fact that we are all the human beings with the emotional system and the cognitive system. \ ","[1]Shiizuka, H.
