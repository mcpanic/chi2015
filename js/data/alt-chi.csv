Digital devices – unlike newspapers – have the capacity to log interaction data. We are still some way from fully exploiting it however, due to the data’s size and complexity. Rather than simply logging data and trying to make sense of it, we suggest designing-in detailed UX-analytics. We report our experience challenging interaction designers to consider what they would like to know about the user, and how they could capture this data – from the starting point of a sentient newspaper.","Michael Evans","michael.evans@bbc.co.uk","1.

We set out the moral case for change, before providing a summary of UK disability discrimination law which we use identify sources of direct and indirect discrimination. Our goal has been to go beyond just accessibility: instead we emphasize disability inclusion in a much broader sense, and articulate a range of steps that can be conducted in order to meet this.

To develop this thought, we examine two ‘found designs’ that have a cultural significance and are deeply embedded in everyday practices – the cigarette and the torii gate. These objects are seen as somewhere between a detour or a portal for the authors in practicing mindfulness. Using these examples, we discuss the subtle space between designing for mindfulness, which we believe is unachievable, and being aware as designers that the tools we make can have this further potential use.

For investigations questioning interactions in public or transient spaces, crowd interaction, or natural behaviour, uncontrolled and uninfluenced (by the experimenter) experiences represent the ideal evaluation environment. We argue that covert research can be completed rigorously and ethically to expand our knowledge of ubiquitous technologies.  Our approach, which we call Deep Cover HCI, utilises technology-supported observation in public spaces to stage completely undisturbed experiences for evaluation.  We complete studies without informed consent and without intervention from an experimenter in order to gain new insights into how people use technology in public settings.  We argue there is clear value in this approach, reflect on the ethical issues of such investigations, and describe our ethical guidelines for completing Deep Cover HCI Research.

Even if it now primarily relies on digital media, academic publishing still generally adheres to its historical rigid paper-based style—where static content is presented at the ready-to-print letter format. In this paper, we reflect on our experience of authoring a published academic article that embeds an animated figure and discuss the opportunities and caveats of transitioning to such practice at the wider academic literature scale.","Tovi Grossman","tovi.grossman@autodesk.com","1.

Among other factors, these groups differed in their education, technology literacy and physical functioning. Through observational measurements, we outline significant differences and trends in players’ paired interaction, which progressively changed through prolonged exposure to the game. By comparing player performance both within and between groups, we raise questions and provide some insights as to how differences in the backgrounds of older players can influence dyadic interaction in collocated play.","Mark Rice ","mdice@i2r.a-star.edu.sg","[1] Andrews, G.

For the non-UX professional this questionnaire can act as an interview script to ascertain how professional a potential UX candidate is during a job interview. This paper also infers a need for a governing body of some kind to assure the quality of the practitioner. The test can be taken and evaluated.

'Extended minds' have gained acclaim in digital times, but have also stirred fear: do objects become smarter at our expense? We propose a new approach to help cultivate auspicious cognitive relationships with things: the 'extended object'. If our thoughts are extended through things, things can be symmetrically and methodically extended through our thoughts – in conversation, and in time.

While most telepresence systems have been designed to provide a remote user’s existence with a teleoperated robot, the system uses a real human as a surrogate for another remote user. To do this, a surrogate user wears a mask-shaped display that shows a remote user’s live face, and a voice channel transmits a remote user’s voice. A surrogate user mimics a remote user by following the remote user’s directions. This design is based on our hypothesis assuming physical and social telepresence can be embodied by such a surrogate human who imitates the remote user. It also eliminates many difficulties of teleoperated robots wandering in the environment. Our pilot study confirmed that people could regard the masked person as a right person.","Kana Misawa","kana.misawa@gmail.com","1.

We utilize eye-tracking technology to observe the complex vision cycles of an artist’s drawing process, and a digital drawing tablet to capture motor activity. Early results suggest that deeper investigation of the relationship of eye and hand movement during artistic drawing may help to extend access to cognitive processes involved in the behavior and embodied response of artistic practice. We propose that a synthesis of phenomenological and technological modalities helps extend creative interactivity in computationally mediated self-expression.","Suk Kyoung Choi","choisukc@sfu.ca","1.

In doing so HCI is increasingly collaborating with artists who engage with real world data. Much of this work focuses on engaging the public in the spectacle of interactive experiences. In contrast, this paper takes a look behind the scenes by studying a collaboration between artists, climate scientists and researchers as they designed a participatory sensing system to interpret scientific data for public presentation. This paper presents this cross-disciplinary approach from the perspective of an artist/researcher on the project.","Rachel Jacobs","rachel.jacobs@nottingham.ac.uk","1. Aoki, P. M., Honicky, R.

Committed to player-centric design ethics, GAH seeks to dismantle the “games for health” myth as neo-liberal elitist diktat. We acknowledge the values, tastes and pleasures of billions of game players worldwide. We argue that game designers should engage more efficiently in the disimprovement of player health and wellbeing in order to cater to those players’ existing preferences. We hope the paper can serve as a convenient reference for those designing psychotic, sociopathic or antisocial games.","Conor Linehan","clinehan@lincoln.ac.uk","1. Alvarez, G. G., & Ayas, N. T.

This is a huge and complex societal problem. Despite the multi-faceted nature of the problem, we propose that HCI researchers can still make a positive contribution in this space through the design of technologies that support citizens to engage with issues of surveillance. In this paper we describe the design of a messaging application called Captchat. Captchat enables people to send everyday messages embedded into images, with the added ability to apply visual distortions to the message to resemble an online CAPTCHA. We propose the chief benefit would be that Captchat messages (with potentially “one-time” distortions) can increase the difficulty for algorithms to index private messages and necessitate the involvement of much more costly human labor in the surveillance process. We developed a prototype and conducted a user study; the results suggest that people were likely to create Captchat messages that were difficult to index for an OCR package but still easy to understand by humans, even without explicit instructions to interact ‘securely’ with the application. While more work is still required to understand the limitations of Captchat, we hope it can open discussion on how HCI researchers can respond to the challenges faced from ubiquitous surveillance.","Paul Dunphy","paulmdunphy@gmail.com","1.
