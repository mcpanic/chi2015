Computers are becoming smaller and smaller, smarter and smarter. Everyone is now surrounded by many visible and invisible computers, which are all highly connected through the Internet ubiquitously. A new world of artificial intelligence is emerging. When the intelligence of human-being is expanded to his/her surroundings, condensed into a new kind of Intelligent life, the relationship between human-being and the rest of the world has been redefined. How to cross the boundaries and to enable the sustainable interaction between nature (the 1st system), human-beings (the 2nd system), artificial world (the 3rd system), and the cyber world (the 4th system), becomes an interesting proposition and merits new design. But before that, it’s necessary to rethink the anthropocentric view and even design itself. The most attractive feature of design is optimistic. What makes a human being human, lies in that one is not leading a kind of life which merely has needs to be fulfilled, but can also use his/her subjective initiative to control and conduct his/her behavior for a certain common value. Today sustainability is not only a value of ethics, but a value of surviving. How to use and encourage a new kind of HCI design, to generate sustainable behaviors and social changes, further, to redesign the commensalism of the four systems mentioned above will be the main focus of my talk.","Bo Begole","bo@begole.net","Professor Dr. Lou Yongqi is Dean of the College of Design and Innovation at Tongji University in Shanghai.

Large-scale behavioral data enables researchers and practitioners to detect adverse drug reactions and interactions, to understand how information diffuses through social networks, how people browse and search for information, how individual learning strategies are related to educational outcome, etc.  Using examples from search, I will highlight how observational logs provide a rich new lens onto the diversity of searchers, tasks, and interactivity that characterize information systems today, and how experimental logs have revolutionized the way in which web-based systems are designed and evaluated.  Although logs provide a great deal of information about what people are doing, they provide little insight about why they are doing so or whether they are satisfied.  Complementary methods from observations, laboratory studies and panels are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of and support for search which is increasingly a core fabric of people’s everyday lives.  The CHI community should lead the way in shaping best practices and policy in behavioral log studies.","Bo Begole","bo@begole.net","Susan Dumais is a Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft and Deputy Managing Director of the Microsoft Research Lab in Redmond.

Thinking is a distributed, situated, and social activity that exploits the extraordinary facilities of language, representational media, and embodied interaction with the world. Today we increasingly think with computers. This includes desktop and laptop computers but more and more involves massive computer networks that deliver search results and provide access to a vast array of cloud-based services.  \ At the same time, the monolithic computer of the recent past is coming apart and being reassembled in myriad new forms, including cell phones, tablets, digital pens, cameras that allow focusing after a picture is taken, glasses that can take a picture of what we see and tell us about it, sensors that capture our activity and support interaction by movement of hands and bodies as well as voice and eyes, and even cars that drive themselves.  \ We are on the threshold of an era that is being described as the Internet of Things or, perhaps more accurately, as the Internet of Everything. The historical moment when people primarily worked in front of a single computer has passed. Computers are ubiquitous. They are being embedded in virtually every new device and the Internet and wireless communication enable their connection to each other and to ever-expanding information resources with previously unimaginable computational power. This is being accelerated by a radically changing cost structure in which the price is the same or less to use a thousand computers for a minute or a day than to use one computer for a thousand minutes or days. These and related developments are fundamentally changing the world in which we live and the ways we think, communicate, and interact within it. \ Yet for all their capacity and speed, using computers too often remains difficult, awkward, and frustrating. Even after six decades of design evolution there is little of the naturalness, spontaneity, and contextual sensitivity that characterize other activities nor is there the conviviality and flexibility of working with tangible media. Most time using computers is spent within applications, each designed to support specific functions and allowing interaction with information in only predetermined ways that are rarely sensitive to overall activity context or history of use and far too often we can look, but not touch, annotate, or personalize the information involved.  \ Access to information needed to conduct daily life is spread across multiple applications and resources, resulting in fragmentation of activities and increased complexity. The rapidly expanding world of mobile apps, which are often walled off from each other and from other information sources, and the increasing use of multiple devices further fragments the ways we work and interact. Although we commonly use paper and digital work materials together, they remain elements of two distinct worlds. \ Disconnects between digital and physical worlds, lack of naturalness and context sensitivity, inability to tailor and personalize information and our interaction with it, and fragmentation of real activities across multiple applications and devices are systemic problems and unfortunately becoming accepted features of modern life.  \ In this talk I argue that we need to challenge the legacy document- and application-centric view of information. We must design environments that move beyond simple metaphor-based imitation of static information entities to ones in which information is dynamic, operating according to cognitively-inspired physics that exploit human abilities, are sensitive to context and history, link the digital and physical worlds, and support web-scale information activities. \ ","Bo Begole","bo@begole.net","Jim Hollan is Professor of Cognitive Science & Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, where he co-directs the Design Lab with Don Norman and Scott Klemmer. Following a postdoc in AI at Stanford, Hollan led the UCSD Intelligent Systems Group in the Institute for Cognitive Science and the Future Technologies Group at NPRDC.  \ He left UCSD to become Director of the MCC Human Interface Lab and subsequently established the Computer Graphics and Interactive Media Research Group at Bellcore. He then moved to the University of New Mexico as Chair of the Computer Science Department and returned to UC San Diego in 1997.  \ Hollan's early work explored graphical interfaces to aid understanding of complex dynamic systems. This work resulted in a series of training systems (e.g., Steamer [8] and Moboard) and one of the first object-oriented graphics editors for interface design. The science that accompanied these development efforts made significant contributions to understanding direct manipulation interfaces [11] and advancing research on mental models [12].  \ The next phase of Hollan’s research focused on designing multimodal interfaces to high-functionality systems. He lead the Human Interface Lab at MCC in creating the Human Interface Tool Suite (HITS) [9], which was among the first prototyping systems to integrate gestures, graphics, sketching, and natural language.  Other work begun at MCC on history-enriched digital objects [4, 5], collaborative filtering, [6] and beyond-being-there [10] continued when he moved to Bellcore, where he initiated a large scale project to explore multiscale information visualization. The resulting system, Pad++ [1, 2], was a precursor to current zoomable interfaces.  \ When he returned to UCSD, he joined with Ed Hutchins to develop distributed cognition as a theoretical and methodological base for advancing HCI research. In recent work, Hollan and his students are developing tools (ChronoViz [3]) to aid visualization and analysis of multiple streams of video and other time-based data and exploring techniques to help reestablish the context of interrupted activities [7].","[1] Bederson, B.
