It is also often unsafe and inaccessible. Atomatic is an inclusive educative puzzle-like game which teaches concepts of atoms and elements. Atomatic follows an approach where the student figures out concepts by trial and error while playing with the atomic model. The student tries to combine constituents of an atom—protons, neutrons and electrons, aiming to create various elements. The model assists the student in different situations and teaches concepts along the way.","Sylvan Lobo","sylvanlobo@gmail.com","1.

Overall, this has led to sports video games being heavily based on statistical simulations (e.g., how high a shot statistic is determines the success of a shot, not player skill). This takes away from the sport-like aspect of true competition between the players of the game. Jelly Polo is a team-based sports video game which uses small-scale exertion. By providing small-scale exertion, in terms of movement, players can gain expertise development, have individual differences in how they play, and get tired during the course of a game. This makes the game more sport-like and competitive because players have to work to strategize as a team, counter-balance fatigue, and increase their physical and mental skills to win against opponents.","Mike Sheinin","mike.sheinin@usask.ca","1.

Targeted at children 4-7 years old, Word Out employs the Microsoft Kinect to detect the silhouette of players. Players are tasked to use their bodies to match the shapes of the alphabets displayed on the screen. Being explorative in nature, the game promotes creative learning through play, as well as encourages collaboration and kinesthetic learning for children. Over two months, more than 15,000 children have played Word Out installed in two different museums. This paper presents the design and implementation of the Word Out game and preliminary analyses of data collected at the museums to share insights on the potential of meaningful and engaging educational games that promote freedom and encourage creativity in the child.","Felicia Clare Paul","felpaul3@gmail.com","1.

Our evaluation with 12 participants showed that players rated the fun level as 4.17 on a 5-point Likert scale, and 83\\% of the players would like to play TranSection again.

The design of the game pays close attention to inter-species gameplay and the need to capture the attention of the cat while maintaining its appeal to the human.  The game consists of an interactive floor projection with two distinct input methods, a Wiimote game controller for use by the human player and a Kinect sensor to track the movement of the cat.  Initial tests have shown the game to engage humans and cats in gameplay and highlight the way for further developments in inter-species gameplay.","Rui Trindade","rui.antero.trindade@gmail.com","1.

A child may even imagine himself as a giant among his toys in his play. To rebuild such pretend play, immersive gaming experience is required throughout the gameplay. We introduce Fighting Gulliver, featuring an innovative game design that integrates cutting-edge technologies including virtual reality (VR), body motion input methods, mobile devices, and wearable devices. The player with VR headsets and body motion capturing devices plays as the giant, while others without the two devices join forces to defeat the giant. Players playing character roles other than the giant are not limited on a desktop device. Entering the game through different devices results in different character roles, skills, and user interfaces. As a result, Fighting Gulliver is a cross-platform multiplayer online role-playing game (MORPG) with novel gaming experience and unique game settings rarely found in previous works. Game balance design and a user study are also discussed in this work.","Min-Chieh Hsiu","jesse801122@gmail.com","1. Microsoft.
