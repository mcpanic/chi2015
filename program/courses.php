    <h4 class="title">Learn to Sketch (Even if You Can’t Draw): Hands-on Sketching Course</h4>

    <div class="instructors">
    Stephanie Foehrenbach , Zuehlke Engineering AG, Schlieren, Zuerich, Switzerland


    </div>
    <div class="candb">
    Sketching as a technique to quickly draw ideas is used to explore and
    communicate ideas. This course introduces basic sketching techniques and
    a visual language, which participants can immediately apply.
    </div>
    <div class="description">
    Sketching as a technique to quickly draw ideas on a sheet of paper can be
    used to document, explore and communicate concepts and ideas. Sketches
    can help to elicit feedback from stakeholders and users in an early phase
    of the project and therefore prevent from getting on the wrong track.
    Within the user centered design process, sketches can further be a mean
    to quickly and inexpensively explore interaction concepts. They can be
    used to create storyboards and inform wireframes and prototypes. The
    ability to draw sketches can be a powerful extension for a
    practitioner’s toolbox.
<br/><br/>
    However, the task of producing sketches can be challenging, especially if
    drawing skills are lacking. In this course, participants will be
    introduced to basic sketching techniques and a visual language, which
    they can immediately apply. It is not a theoretical course but rather a
    lot of hands-on exercise for the participants.
<br/><br/>
    During the course participants will learn:<br/>
    - how to communicate visually<br/>
    - how to visualize ideas just on the spot<br/>
    - and how to get over the fear from an empty sheet of paper.
<br/><br/>
    Everybody engaged in the field of human computer interaction is welcome
    to this course and there are no prerequisites required. The course is
    most valuable for practitioners such as user experience professionals,
    requirements engineers or product managers.
<br/><br/>
    The course is given by Stephanie Foehrenbach (M.Sc., Dipl. Inform. (FH)).
    Stephanie is a usability lead consultant and trainer employed by Zuehlke
    in Switzerland. She works for clients from various industries.

    <h4 class="title">Introduction to Creating Musical Interfaces</h4>

    <div class="instructors">
    Michael Lyons , Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto, Japan <br/>
    Sidney Fels , University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
    </div>
    <div class="candb">
    This course provides a gentle and fun introduction to the practice of
    musical interface design. Participants will gain sufficient knowledge of
    tools and methods to start their own projects.
    </div>
    <div class="description">
    This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of
    musical interface design. Our target audience consists of those who are
    interested in starting projects relating to music technology. Those with
    a general interest are also welcome. Participants will learn key aspects
    of the theory and practice of musical interface design by studying case
    studies and practical know-how sourced mainly from the leading conference
    in this area, known as "New Interfaces for Musical Expression" or NIME.
    Advances in digital audio technologies have led to a situation where
    computers play a role in most music production and performance. Digital
    technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for the creation and
    manipulation of sound, however the flexibility of these new technologies
    implies a confusing array of choices for musical composers and
    performers. Some artists have faced this challenge by using computers
    directly to create music. However, most would agree that the computer is
    not a musical instrument, in the same sense as traditional instruments,
    and it is natural to ask "how to play the computer" using interface
    technology appropriate for human brains and bodies. In two eighty minute
    sessions we will introduce an approach to the design of musical
    interfaces. The first session is presented in lecture format with many
    video demonstrations of musical interfaces. The second session
    illustrates the design and prototyping process with case studies, and
    continues with live demonstrations of hardware and software tools used
    for musical interface projects. The course concludes with a group design
    exercise in which attendees will sketch their original ideas for new
    musical interfaces. The course is aimed at beginners but more experienced
    participants will have plenty to explore. Familiarity with basic aspects
    of interactive media will be helpful, however there are no specific
    technical prerequisites. No background in music or computer audio is
    assumed.

<h4 class="title">Designing with the Mind in Mind: The Psychological Basis for UI Design Guidelines</h4>

<div class="instructors">
Jeff Johnson , UI Wizards, Inc, San Francisco, California, United States
</div>
<div class="candb">
By understanding the underlying psychology for the design rules,
designers and evaluators enhance their ability to interpret and apply
them.  Explaining that psychology is the focus of this course.
</div>
<div class="description">
Benefits: UI design rules and guidelines are not simple recipes.
Applying them effectively requires determining rule applicability and
precedence and balancing trade-offs when rules compete.  By understanding
the underlying psychology, designers and evaluators enhance their ability
to apply design rules. This one-part (80-minute) course explains that
psychology.
<br/><br/>
Origins:  Presented at CHI 2008, 2009, and 2012.  Revised based on recent
2nd edition of book.
<br/><br/>
Features:<br/>
Introduction<br/>
Perception<br/>
• Perception is biased by experience, context, goals<br/>
• Vision is optimized to perceive structure (Gestalt principles)<br/>
• We seek and use structure<br/>
• Color vision is limited<br/>
• Peripheral vision is poor, and visual search is linear unless target
“pops” in periphery Cognition<br/>
• Attention is limited; Memory is imperfect<br/>
• Limits on attention and memory shape our thought and action, e.g.,
change-blindness<br/>
• Recognition is easier than recall<br/>
• Easy: learning from experience and executing learned actions; Hard:
novel actions, problem-solving, and calculation
<br/><br/>
Audience: Designers and developers of all levels, especially those
lacking education in recent perceptual and cognitive psychology.  Also:
Q/A and usability engineers.
<br/><br/>
Presentation:  Lecture, brief demonstrations with audience participation, Q&A.
<br/><br/>
Instructor background:  Jeff Johnson is Principal Consultant at UI
Wizards and co-founder of Wiser Usability.  After earning B.A. and Ph.D.
degrees in cognitive psychology from Yale and Stanford, he worked at
Cromemco, Xerox, US West, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun.  Since 1996 he has
been a consultant.  He has taught at Stanford, Mills, and the University
of Canterbury.  He is a member of the CHI Academy.  He authored articles
and chapters on HCI, as well as the books GUI Bloopers, Web Bloopers, GUI
Bloopers 2.0, Designing with the Mind in Mind, and Conceptual Models

    <div class="instructors">


Kathy Baxter , Google, Inc., Mountain View, California, United States <br/>
Anna Avrekh , Google Inc, New York City, New York, United States <br/>
Bob Evans , User Experience Research Infrastructure, Google, Inc., Mountain View, California, United States
</div>
<div class="candb">
Attendees will obtain the skills to design, conduct, and analyze data
from an ESM study in order to capture a deeper, more holistic
understanding of their users.
</div>
<div class="description">
Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) is a type of longitudinal diary
study that allows one to understand a person’s experience in the
moment. It combines the qualitative richness of longitudinal diary
studies, artifacts of a field study, and quantitative data of a
large-scale survey or app tracker. Using a free, open-source mobile app
called “PACO (Personal Analytics COmpanion),” we can conduct ESM
studies with participants anywhere in the world. This workshop will give
attendees the skills to design, conduct, and analyze data from ESM
studies. Prior to attending the course, attendees will be invited to
participate in a sample ESM study so they can see what the experience is
like from a participant’s point of view. After giving a brief overview
of what ESM is and the history, we will discuss best practices for study
design including when ESM is appropriate, considerations for ensuring
validity and reliability, and guidance for signal scheduling. We will
introduce the PACO app (www.pacoapp.com) for conducting ESM studies on
mobile devices and conduct a demonstration of how to use the tool. To
better understand how to conduct a large-scale ESM study, we will discuss
one such study the Google Search User Experience Research team conducted
with 1200 participants across the US. We will then walk attendees through
each step of the process to conduct a successful ESM study, including
creating the data collection form, recruiting recommendations,
participant instructions, incentive recommendations, participant
retention, and participation monitoring. Next will be a discussion of how
to analyze data from an ESM study. In the last portion of the class,
attendees will pair up to design their own ESM study, build it in PACO,
and launch it to themselves to test. This hands-on exercise will ensure
everyone has the skills upon leaving the class to build their own
studies.

    <h4 class="title">Conceptual Models: Core to Good Design</h4>

<div class="instructors">
Jeff Johnson , UI Wizards, Inc, San Francisco, California, United States
</div>
<div class="candb">
Teaches the benefits of designing a conceptual model (CM) of apps before
designing the UI, the components of CMs and how to create them, and
provides experience designing a CM.
</div>
<div class="description">
A crucial step in designing a UI for a software application is
to design a coherent, task-focused conceptual model.  With a CM,
designers design better, developers develop better, and users learn and
use better.  Unfortunately, this step is often skipped in software
design, resulting in incoherent, arbitrary, inconsistent, overly-complex
applications that impede design, development, learning, understanding,
and use.  Based on the presenter's (coauthored) book: Conceptual Models:
Core to Good Design.  It covers:<br/>
• What CMs are.<br/>
• How they improve software design and development.<br/>
• Perils of skipping CMs.<br/>
• Object/operations analysis.<br/>
• Examples of CMs.<br/>
• A hands-on exercise designing a CM.
<br/><br/>
The course presentation consists of lecture, Q&A, and audience exercises.
 Most of the second segment consists of hands-on exercises and
discussion.
<br/><br/>
The intended audience is designers and developers of all levels, as well
as Q/A engineers, usability testers, and managers.
<br/><br/>
Instructor background:  Jeff Johnson is Principal Consultant at UI

If we want technology to increase worldwide wellbeing, we have to design
for wellbeing directly. Positive computing – the development of
technology to support psychological wellbeing and human potential
</div>
<div class="description">
A growing number of HCI professionals are asking how we might design
technology to foster psychological wellbeing.  Meeting such an aim will
involve a crossing of disciplines, of methods, and a new way of thinking
about what technology should be doing for us. By turning to
well-established research in psychology, education, neuroscience, and
HCI, we can begin to cultivate a field dedicated to the development of
technology that supports wellbeing and human potential, a field we refer
to as positive computing.  Using multidisciplinary approaches,
researchers have begun to explore how digital experience can support
wellbeing determinants like self-awareness, autonomy, resilience,
mindfulness, and altruism.

<div class="candb">
This course will teach attendees how to design and evaluate interaction
with online video and television. It provides a pragmatic toolset,
techniques and guidelines, which can be applied in practice
</div>
<div class="description">
In this course, the instructors will first give an extensive overview of
successful existing and emerging television and online video
applications, on the web, on television and on smartphones and tablets,
and present them in a coherent framework. The framework will help in
understanding the relevance of these emergent applications for the CHI
community, in particular which aspects of user experience are relevant
for TV and video applications and which interaction design techniques can
be of help when designing them.
<br/><br/>
Next, the instructors will provide a detailed overview on the design of
online video and television applications that exploit novel features,
with an emphasis on social interactivity, interaction techniques and
content. This will be illustrated by using existing design projects,
including secondary screens, rich social experiences with other viewers
and social sharing of television content with closed relationships.
<br/><br/>
After this, we will show how TV and online video applications can be
evaluated. First we will discuss how usability and sociability can be
studied by performing user tests, which aspects of testing are different
from studying applications in other domains, and include practical tips
on how to improve user testing focused on the user experience of TV and
online video. Then we will go over a number of heuristics, based on the
design principles discussed earlier, for designing online video and
television applications.
<br/><br/>
In order to better explain the underlying concepts, we will perform a
plenary group exercise in which the participants are invited to apply the
design principles and heuristics and evaluate and redesign an online
video application.
<br/><br/>
Finally, the instructors will explore the future of the emerging trends
in TV and online video and together with the participants discuss what
factors can lead to the success or failure of these kinds of
applications.

</div>
<div class="candb">
Learn how speech recognition and synthesis works, what are its
limitations and usability challenges, how can it enhance interaction
paradigms, and what is the current research and commercial
state-of-the-art.
</div>
<div class="description">
Speech remains the "holy grail" of interaction, as this is the most
natural form of communication that humans employ. Unfortunately, it is
also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -
despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication
channel we possess. While significant research effort, in engineering,
linguistics and psychology, have been spent on improving machines'
ability to understand and synthesize speech, the HCI community has been
relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of
research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging
levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often
unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic
difficulty of designing and especially evaluating interfaces that use
speech and natural language as an input or output modality. While the
accuracies of understanding speech input are still discouraging for many
applications under less-than-ideal conditions, several interesting areas
have yet to be explored that could make speech-based interaction truly
hands-free. The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the
current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of
the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an
opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how
speech recognition and synthesis work, what are their limitations, and
how these could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through
this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to
combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles
in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.

<div class="description">
We as researchers and User Experience (UX) designers want to identify and create products
that change the world and therefore, we choose to engage in strategic research and design.
In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design
doesn’t mean it will automatically be accepted or get to market. By definition,
innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have
anti-innovation antibodies that often kill new ideas— even disruptive innovations that
could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as
coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea
often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide
space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need
new tools to meet this challenge—tools that empower UX teams in both business and
universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and
designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs—a design-led, facilitative,
cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates
value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who
systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas.
Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free
expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user
testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies and universities, such as
Splunk, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, the Berlin Technical University, Yahoo!, Mindjet,
zSpace, HP, and more identify, design, and bring great products to market.

Through both lecture material and interactive group activities, gain a
practical understanding of the survey research lifecycle, including
sampling considerations, questionnaire design, questionnaire biases, and
evaluation.
</div>
<div class="description">
Surveys, now commonplace on the Web, allow researchers to make inferences
about an entire population by gathering information from a small subset
of the larger group. Surveys can gather insights about people’s
attitudes, perceptions, intents, habits, awareness, experiences, and
characteristics, both at significant moments in time and over time. At a
glance, many tools are available and the cost of conducting surveys
appears low. However, there is a wide gap between quick-and-dirty
surveys, and surveys that are properly planned, constructed, and
analyzed.
<br/><br/>
Course attendees, either new to surveys or somewhat experienced but
interested in the latest advances, will gain a practical understanding of
the survey research lifecycle, from goals to planning, sampling
considerations, questionnaire design, and evaluation. This course will
also focus on demonstrating common questionnaire biases while providing
best practices on how to minimize them. The role of survey research
within HCI will also be discussed by highlighting common applications and
by examining frequently used standardized questionnaires to measure
usability and other aspects within HCI. The course will combine lecture
material with relevant real-world examples; a major portion will be
dedicated to interactive group activities during which attendees will
apply some of the learned material to reviewing and revising example
survey questions. No formal prerequisites are required to attend this
course.
<br/><br/>
This course will be facilitated by two experienced senior user experience
researchers from Google who each have a proven track record in using
survey research in the field of HCI. They have held several workshops,
given talks, and published about survey research at various HCI/UX venues
over the past years.

This course takes a practical approach to the principles, methods and
tools in task modelling. Part 1 is introductory while Part 2 is
interactive hands-on exercises about how to "do-it-right".
</div>
<div class="description">
This two-part course takes a practical approach to the principles,
methods and tools in task modelling. Part 1: A non-technical introduction
demonstrates that task models support successful design of interactive
systems. Foundations of task models are introduced followed by a review
of notations and tools for describing users’ tasks. Three simple
real-life examples are used throughout this introduction. Part 2: A more
technical interactive hands-on exercise of how to "do-it-right" e.g. How
to go from task analysis to task models? How to assess (through analysis
and simulation) that a task model is correct? How to identify complexity
of user tasks and how to reduce it? How to identify tasks that are good
candidate for migration either towards automation or other users?
Audience: HCI researchers, practitioners, and students. No prior
knowledge of task modeling is required. Teaching Methods: Lecture,
interactive exercises supported by software tool (HAMSTERS – provided
to attendees). Instructors’ Background: Prof. Philippe Palanque
research work is on bringing together Usability and Reliability in
Interactive Systems. He has been working for over 20 years to integrate
task modeling in the design on Interactive Systems using scalable
notations and interactive tools. He has been teaching task modeling in
various places e.g. University of Toulouse (France), University of
Salzburg (Austria) and University of Granada (Spain). Philippe has been
the recipient of the IFIP Silver Core award, is a member of the
Distinguished Speaker Program at ACM and was the general co-chair of CHI
2014. Célia Martinie is Assistant Professor in Computer Science at

<div class="instructors">
Nigel Bevan , Professional Usability Services, London, United Kingdom
</div>
<div class="candb">
Learn how international standards can provide a sound basis for
educational and training, can provide authority for design and
development, and are a rich source of guidance and reference material.
</div>
<div class="description">
ISO standards for HCI contain an authoritative collation of existing
knowledge and good practice that has been contributed by international
experts.  The course will clarify the value provided by international
standards, and their benefits and limitations.  In many cases the
standards are more comprehensive than any textbook.  The course will
explain how use of international standards can contribute to:
<br/><br/>
- Better user interface design: interfaces can be evaluated against the
ISO guidelines, which can also provide authoritative evidence to cite if
a user interface design decision is challenged.<br/>
- How to produce reliable usability test data by following the ISO
usability test method and using the ISO format for usability reports.<br/>
- Documenting information about usability.  ISO standards define the
essential information that should be included in a user needs report and
a description of the context of use.<br/>
- Broadening then concept of usability to include accessibility, user
experience and freedom from unnecessary risk.<br/>
- Good practice in user centred design: ISO standards specify all the key
elements that need to be included.<br/>
- Helping your organisation improve its process.  Projects and
organisations can compare their activities with the comprehensive and
authoritative ISO definition of the processes that are needed to
implement user-centered design.<br/>
- Making usability and UX a part of systems engineering: ISO standards
show how to integrate usability into the requirements and systems
development processes.
<br/><br/>
The potential value of using these standards will be explained for
example situations proposed by the audience.
<br/><br/>
The course will be useful for anyone interested in using international
standards to benefit their professional work or activities in their
organization, or to use as a basis for educational or training material.
Basic familiarity with HCI and usability is assumed.

In this hands-on sketching course participants will learn easy to apply
sketching methods for generating and refining ideas for HCI research and
design.

</div>
<div class="description">
When designing novel user interfaces, paper-pencil sketches can support
the design thinking process and are ideal for sharing design ideas with
others. This hands-on course will demonstrate how to integrate sketching
into researchers’ and interaction designers’ everyday practice.
Participants will learn essential sketching strategies, apply these in
practice during many hands-on exercises, and learn the various ways of
using sketches as a tool when working on HCI projects. The demonstrated
sketching techniques include, for example:
<br/><br/>
* Developing your sketching vocabulary<br/>
* Rapid sketching of people, emotions, gestures, and objects<br/>
* 10 plus 10 design funnel<br/>
* Photo tracing and creating hybrid sketches<br/>
* Interface sketches and rapid wireframing<br/>
* Storyboards for interaction sequences<br/>
* Sketch boards, critique, and sharing
<br/><br/>
We will demonstrate many best practices and sketching shortcuts, and
involve all participants in joint sharing and discussion sessions of the
sketches created during the different hands-on activities. We will
demonstrate how we used sketching techniques in many of our recent
projects when designing interactive systems, and highlight how to apply
the learned sketching techniques during all stages of the design process.

Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms (transformable
