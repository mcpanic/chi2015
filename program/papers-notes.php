<p>
You can access the program across devices. You <a href="http://confer.csail.mit.edu/login?redirect_url=/chi2015/papers">create an account to save your favorite papers and personal schedule</a>. Or, you can <a href="http://confer.csail.mit.edu/chi2015/papers">browse the program as a guest</a>.
</p>

<p>
Marking papers you're interested in will help you organize your schedule. But your activities will help the entire CHI community at the same time! Confer can improve its recommendation as more attendees specify interests. Also, conference organizers can better match sessions to rooms for an improved conference experience for everyone.
