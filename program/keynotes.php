<h4>UX Design in the IoT Era</h4>
<p>
The current advancement of IoT technology has accelerated the era of
hyper-connectivity in our lives.
This has vastly driven convergence among different fields along with
the expansion of our thoughts and behaviors.
However, to provide meaningful experiences, these relational
expansions and unprecedented possibilities opened up
by IoT need to be founded on core human values. Furthermore,
harmonious integration between technology and design is also
essential.
Today, I would like to talk about what must be done in order to foster
the IoT as a human-centered innovation and
how UX design can realize the well balanced and harmonious IoT environment.
