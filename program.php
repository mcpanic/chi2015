  <p>The CHI 2015 program will be updated as more venues finalize their schedule.</p>

  <p>
    This year, CHI is planning to provide simultaneous translation from English to Chinese,
    Japanese and Korean in the main auditorium throughout the first and last day of conference,
    covering the Opening and Closing sessions along with other sessions.  Additional translation
    support such as machine translation and closed captioning will be available for other sessions
    throughout the conference.
