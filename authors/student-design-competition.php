<h3 ><a name="TOC-Message-from-the-Student-Design-Competition-Chairs"></a>Message from the Student Design Competition Chairs</h3>

<div align="left" ><span>This is the 13th
year of the CHI Student Design Competition. The Student Design Competition
continues to grow each year with increased international representation. The
competition always draws a large audience at CHI and has also become a major
recruiting opportunity for identifying talented students. In previous years,
there have been over 60 international submissions from more than 10
countries and we hope to continue this trend in both submission
numbers and quality. With your entries, we hope to make the first CHI Student
Design Competition in Asia exciting, innovative, and attractive for all
participants. We look forward to your entries.</span></div>
<div align="left" ><span><br>
</span></div>
<div align="left" ><span>New for CHI 2015:</span></div>
<ul><li>
<div align="left" ><span><span>This year we plan to have both posters and videos included in the ACM Digital Library along with the Extended Abstract. </span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left" ><span><span><span>A Video submission is required when you submit your Round One submission. Some videos may also be selected to be shown in the video showcase.</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="left" ><span><span><span><span>Student Design Competition&nbsp;submissions&nbsp;may be resubmitted to other design competitions (external to CHI).</span></span></span></span></div>

<h3 >What is the
Student Design Competition?</h3>

<p align="left" ><span>The Student Design Competition is
aimed at meeting three goals:</span></p>
<ul>
 <li ><span>Provide an opportunity
     for students from a variety of design backgrounds (HCI, industrial design,
     product design, visual design, interaction design etc.) to participate in
     CHI and demonstrate their problem solving and design skills in an
     international competition against their peers.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
 <li ><span>Provide CHI attendees
     with refreshing perspectives on how design teams from different
     disciplines and different parts of the world approach a common design
     problem.<br>
<br>
</span></li>
 <li ><span>Provide CHI attendees
     with a chance to meet future professionals in our area, and provide
     competition participants with an opportunity to network with experienced
     HCI and Design professionals.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 >The Design
Problem</h3>


<p align="left" ><span>The CHI 2015's
theme is "crossings" which focuses on crossing the boundaries for
meaningful new creations and possibilities. In this year's Student Design
Competition, we adapt this theme of "crossings" and hope to open up
the opportunities for students in the areas of HCI and Design from all over the
world to show their visions and competence on enabling people from different
cultures to be connected and to be heard and appreciated.</span></p>
<p align="left" ><span>In the last few
years, smart devices have become more or less standardized in their physical
and graphical forms. While new groups of users are constantly emerging, quite a
few people still stay away from the benefits of technology. The theme of this
year's Student Design Competition is "Appropriating Technologies for New
Cultures". We invite entries under this broad theme. </span></p>
<p align="left" ><span>We are asking you
to design a product, application, technology, or service that enable people who
are a new and completely unexplored user group in any country to appropriate
things and technologies around them. This user group may be a minority, an
extreme case, or somehow disconnected from the mainstream. We ask you to
showcase your best abilities of "maker cultures" to build new
connections and to make less-voiced cultures be better heard. We ask you to use
technology as a material for crafting and tinkering, and to make sure that you
solve real problems, empower people in a unique way, and let them express their
colors and needs.</span></p>
<p align="left" ><span>For this year’s
design problem, we particularly invite students’ careful considerations of the
following criteria: </span></p>
<ul>
 <li ><span>Does the solution solve a
     real problem of a real user group?</span></li>
 <li ><span>Is the user group
     disconnected from current technologies?</span></li>
 <li ><span>Does the solution use
     technology in a unique and creative way to solve the problem?</span></li>
 <li ><span>Were relevant prior works
     properly cited?</span></li>
 <li ><span>Were analysis, synthesis,
     design and evaluation sufficient and systematic?</span></li>
 <li ><span>Was the fidelity of the
     prototypes sufficient to demonstrate the ideas?</span></li>
 <li ><span>Was the solution
     well-presented?</span></li>
</ul>
<span>
<h3 >Student Team Requirements</h3>
<p align="left" ><span>Teams must consist of at least two, but no more than five students. There is no limit to the number of teams that may compete from any given University or organization. However, one student cannot be part of multiple teams.</span></p>
<p align="left" ><span>Submissions are invited from all students at all stages of their university careers, from undergraduate to postgraduate. While not a mandatory requirement, it is strongly encouraged that the teams put forward a multidisciplinary, multi-national team.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br>

<h3 >The Competition
Structure</h3>

<p align="left" ><span>The competition
follows a three-round process. Each round focuses on communicating the team's

final version.</span></p>

<h4 ><span><em>Round Two: Poster</em></span></h4>
<strong><em>

</em></strong>
<p align="left" ><span><span>Accepted teams will be     expected to attend the conference to give a poster presentation outlining     their design, and discuss their proposed solution with a panel of Student     Design Competition Judges. </span></span><span>A scheduled
80-minute poster presentation event will take place during the conference.
Student teams will be expected to host their posters and discuss their
approach, design method and solutions with the Student Design Competition
Judges. The competition judges will select four teams to present their proposed
solutions orally during a scheduled presentation session named "Student
Design Competition Final". <span>Teams will be also provided space in the convention center to display posters and discuss their proposed solutions with the CHI 201</span><span>5</span><span> attendees.</span></span></p>
<p align="left" ><span>Specific
guidelines for preparing posters:</span></p>
<ul>
 <li ><span>Each poster will have a
     display space approximately 8 feet wide and 4 feet high.</span></li>
 <li ><span>The poster is expected to
     follow the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format
     (A0). The dimensions for A0 format are 84cm x 119cm, or approximately
     33" x 47". Either landscape or portrait orientation is
     acceptable.</span></li>
 <li ><span>Audiovisual and computing
     equipment will not be supplied. Power outlets will not be available. The
