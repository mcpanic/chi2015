<h3><a name="TOC-Message-from-the-Student-Game-Competition-Chairs"></a>Message from the Work-in-Progress Chairs</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We encourage researchers and practitioners to submit Works-in-Progress as it provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early-stage work, and fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues. Accepted submissions will be presented as a physical poster at the conference and made available to the CHI community through the Extended Abstracts proceedings as a six-page paper also accompanied by a PDF of the poster.</span></p>

<h3><span><span>What is a Work-in-Progress</span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A Work-in-Progress is a concise report of recent findings or other types of innovative or thought-provoking work relevant to the CHI community. The difference between Works-in-Progress and other contribution types (e.g. main track papers and notes) is that Work-in-Progress submissions represent work that has not reach a level of completion that would warrant the full Refereed selection process. That said, appropriate submissions should make a contribution to the body of HCI knowledge, whether realized or promised. A significant benefit of a Work-in-Progress derives from the discussion between the author and conference attendees that will be fostered by the face-to-face presentation of the work.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The Work-in-Progress category aims to attract participation from a broad range of disciplines covering a spectrum of topics and methodologies. We encourage submissions from all of CHI's communities. Please note that summaries of completed work or reduced versions of main track CHI submissions are inappropriate as a Work-in-Progress submission and will be rejected.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Work-in-Progress abstracts appear in the CHI Extended Abstracts proceedings. Copyright is retained by the authors, and the material from them can be used as the basis for future publications as long as there are "significant" revisions from the original. For more information on the republishability of material appearing at CHI, along with links to relevant ACM policies, please see the section on <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/selection-processes#republishability">Republishability</a> on the main CHI CFP.</span></p>
<br>
</div>

<h3><span><span>Preparing and Submitting your Work-in-Progress</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Work-in-Progress submissions consist of two related documents. Failure to submit a valid version of either document will result in an automatic rejection. Due to the very rapid selection process we cannot offer any extensions to the deadline. Both documents will be considered by the reviewers when assessing your submission. The two documents required are:</span></p>
<div>

</div>
<ol>
  <li>A six-page poster abstract prepared in the <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/format#extendedformat">Extended Abstracts Format</a> and submitted as a PDF file. Your poster abstract should be close to camera-ready and thoroughly copy-edited. Work-in-Progress submissions are not anonymous and should therefore include all author names, affiliations and contact information. Please note: Any submission longer than 6 pages and/or not adhering to the Extended Abstracts Format will be automatically rejected.
  </li>

  <li>An electronic version of the poster that you will present at the conference. For the review process, your poster should be reduced to one standard page in size and submitted as a PDF file. Please note that the physical posters presented at the conference may not be larger than A0 size. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(New for CHI 2015) Posters will be archived with the abstracts and final posters will be due at the same time as the publication-ready abstracts.&nbsp;Therefore,<span lang="EN-GB"> please ensure your poster design is as complete
as possible at the original submission.</span></strong><br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Due to the short selection cycle, there should be very, very few changes between your submissions and the camera-ready final documents, except in rare circumstances.</span></p>

<div>
<span>Both the Extended Abstract and the poster should communicate:</span></div>
<ol>
  <li>A concise description of the work</li>
  <li>Implications of the work for the CHI community</li>
  <li>Recommendations for further investigation and/or incorporation into practice</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Examples of posters and Extended Abstracts from CHI 2014 can be found in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2559206&amp;picked=prox&amp;cfid=389990136&amp;cftoken=72399569" target="_blank">ACM DL</a>. Examples of previous WiPs with good posters include <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2581174" target="_blank">this </a>one and <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2581274" target="_blank">this</a> one.</span></p>


<h3><span><span>Work-in-Progress Selection Process</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Work-in-Progress submissions are selected through a Juried process. The process has been designed to acknowledge the early-stage nature of the work. All submissions are considered confidential during the review process.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Each submission will be reviewed on the following criteria:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Significance</b>: How important is the problem or question that this submission addresses? How important is the output of this work in contributing to the identified problem or question? How greatly can others benefit from this work?</li>
  <li><b>Originality</b>: How novel is the contribution? How clearly does the submission communicate the ways that it differs from and goes beyond the most relevant previous work in this area? (Note that for a Work-in-Progress submission, full literature searches are not expected, although the most relevant citations should be included.)</li>
  <li><b>Validity</b>: How appropriate are the chosen methods for the work being undertaken? How well are the submission's claims and conclusions supported by the results?</li>
  <li><b>Written Presentation</b>: How clear and understandable is the writing in the poster abstract? To what extent does the poster abstract conform to all Extended Abstract formatting requirements and the 6-page limit?</li>
  <li><b>Visual Presentation</b> (The Poster): How well does the design of the poster effectively communicate the most important facets of the work? To what degree is the design of the poster likely to draw in an audience?</li>
  <li><b>Ability of the Work to Engender Discussion</b>: To what degree will the presentation of this work stimulate interesting conversation among researchers or practitioners? To what extent will the presenters benefit from being able to discuss their work and receive feedback at this stage?</li></ul>
<p><span>The extended abstract should contain no sensitive, private, or proprietary information that cannot be disclosed at publication time.&nbsp; <span>Submissions should NOT be anonymous. However, confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference,</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;with the exception of title and author information which will be published on the website prior to the conference.</span></span></span></p>


<div>
<h3><span><span>Upon Acceptance of Your Work-in-Progress Submission</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Work-in-Progress authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection on 2 February, 2015.Authors of accepted submissions will receive instructions how to prepare and submit the publication-ready version, and details on the poster presentation and scheduling at the conference.</span></span></p>

</div>

<div>
<h3><span><span>At the Conference</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Authors will be expected to attend the conference and will be assigned a time and location to present their poster to conference attendees. Note that it is possible that each poster may be presented over two consecutive days, so please keep that in mind while making travel plans. Work-in-progress submissions whose authors are not at the conference to present their poster may be withdrawn from the ACM Digital Library. Please see previous year’s CHI programs for examples of typical poster schedules.</span></span></p>

</div>


<div>
<h3><span><span>After the Conference</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Accepted Work-in-Progress poster abstracts and poster PDFs will be made available in the CHI Extended Abstracts, distributed by the conference and in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to researchers and practitioners worldwide.</span></span></p>
