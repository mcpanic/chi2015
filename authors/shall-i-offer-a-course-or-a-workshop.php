<h3 >Example:</h3>
<p>A workshop on prototyping (for example) might encourage sharing of a variety of prototyping tools and methods among people who are accustomed to using one or more of the tools already. The goal of such a workshop would be to clarify issues related to methods and tools, output and success metrics, and additional goals that are appropriate to discussions among experts to extend best practices or create new understandings and practices.</p>
<p>A course on prototyping would introduce the purposes of prototyping, review a selection of prototyping tools and the resultant prototypes. It might discuss how the results would be useful for which types of testing, or shared with a development team.</p>
