<h3><a name="TOC-Message-from-the-Student-Game-Competition-Chairs"></a>Message from the Workshops Chairs</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Workshops are a chance for attendees with common interests to meet in the context of a focused and interactive discussion. They are an opportunity to move a field forward and build community. CHI workshops might address basic research, applied research, HCI practice, HCI education, new methodologies, emerging application areas, design innovations, or management, strategy, and organizational issues. Each workshop should generate ideas that will give the HCI community a new, organized way of thinking about the topic or that suggest promising directions for future work. If you are working in an emerging area in HCI, please consider organizing a workshop. Some workshops have resulted in edited books or special issues of journals; you may consider including this goal in the design of your workshop. Others have created communities that spawned new, more specialized conferences. We invite you to participate in the CHI 2015 Workshops!</span></p>

<h3><span><span>What is a CHI Workshop</span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Workshops are held the weekend before the start of the conference, on Saturday and Sunday, 18-19 April, 2015. A workshop may be one or two days in length. They are scheduled for six working hours per day, with a mid-morning break, a lunch break, and a mid-afternoon break. A typical workshop will have 15 to 25 participants.</span></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Workshops are intended to foster discussion and exchange. Because focused interaction among participants is important, participants should have informed positions based on prior experience, as expressed in their position papers. Workshops should not be miniature paper presentation sessions, but focus on community building and communal knowledge creation. Please note that CHI workshops are not classes in which instructors teach content (see CHI Courses and Shall I offer a course or a workshop? for further guidance).</span></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are two groups of people involved in a workshop: the organizers and the participants. Organizers are responsible for the workshop's topic, logistics, and final outcome. Participants are responsible for the content and discussion. The following is an outline of the submission and organization process.</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Workshop organizers submit a workshop submission package (see below for content and format) to CHI, which is reviewed by a jury of domain and logistics experts and are either accepted or rejected.</li>
<li>The workshop chairs will invite several workshops related to the Crossings conference theme. </li>
  <li>If a workshop is accepted, both CHI and the workshop organizers will publicize the workshop to solicit potential participants to submit position papers. Workshop organizers solicit participants for their workshop through a Workshop Participants Call for Participation and CHI places a link to the workshop's website on the CHI2015 Workshops Page.</li>
  <li>Interested participants in the workshop submit a position paper to the organizers of the workshop. Position papers are statements of interest and/or expertise in the workshop topic, in any format or media as defined by the workshop organizers.</li>
  <li>The workshop organizers will review position papers using their own criteria, and will decide on the final list of participants.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<div>
<h3><span><span>Preparing and Submitting&nbsp;your Workshop Package</span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A workshop submission package <span>must be submitted via the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi" target="_blank">PCS Submission System</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;6 October 2014, 5:00pm PDT. The proposal must have the following four components (submitted as a single PDF file)<span>:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
&nbsp; <li>Cover Sheet. Each submission must have a cover sheet giving contact information for the primary workshop organizer. This person will serve as the main point of contact with the Workshops Chairs.
&nbsp; </li>
&nbsp; <li>Proposal. The proposal must describe the topic and rationale for the workshop, the organizers' backgrounds and a detailed plan for conducting the workshop (before, during, and after). Workshop proposals that articulate concrete plans for pre-workshop preparation and community building (e.g., through a website or other communication with participants) and/or post-workshop follow-up for the creation of tangible outcomes (e.g., poster presentation at the "spotlight on workshops" poster session, publication of a workshop report in the SIGCHI Bulletin or a similar publication, plans for a special issue of a journal) are strongly encouraged. The proposal may not exceed 3 pages and should be prepared in the Conference Extended Abstract Format (<a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/format" target="_blank">http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/format</a><span>).</span></li>
&nbsp; <li>Extented Abstract. The extended abstract is a description of the workshop intended for publication in the CHI 2015 Extended Abstracts and may not exceed four pages. It must contain a summary of the workshop goals, an overview of the workshop topic, and issues to be addressed. It must&nbsp;be prepared in the Conference Extended Abstract Format (<a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/format" target="_blank">http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/format</a><span>).</span>&nbsp;Note that this is the only document from the workshop that will be included in the CHI conference publications.</li>
&nbsp; <li>Call for Participation. The call for participation is a 250-word document that will be posted on the Conference site to recruit participants for the workshop. It should describe the format and goals of the workshop, the participant selection criteria, requirements for position papers (e.g., topics to address, page length), where these papers should be submitted, and state the requirement that at least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop and all participants must register for the workshop and for at least one day of the conference. Upon acceptance, the workshop organizers are required to create a web page with workshop specific information. They should include the future web page url in the submission. The workshop organizers may decide to cap the number of attendees per accepted position paper.</li>
</ol>

</div>


<h3><span><span>Workshop Selection Process</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Workshops are a curated track and highly selective. Workshop proposals will be selected by a jury of experts who will evaluate the work based on how compelling they expect it to be to CHI attendees. While not considered archival, curated content will be represented in the ACM Digital Library. The jury will consider several factors during the selection process, including:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>The potential for the topic of the workshop to generate stimulating discussions and useful results.</li>
  <li>The organizers' ability to demonstrate in the proposal a well-organized process and plan for the workshop that fosters interactivity.</li>
  <li>The overall balance of topics in the Workshops program and relevance to the main conference theme, Crossings.</li>
  <li>The proposed size of the workshop. For large workshops, a clear and workable plan for facilitating a lively environment for discussion for all participants will be scrutinized.</li>
  <li>If multiple submissions are received on the same or similar topics, the organizers may be encouraged to merge them.</li></ul>
<p><span><span><span>Submissions should not contain&nbsp;sensitive, private, or proprietary information that cannot be disclosed at publication time.&nbsp; <span>Submissions </span>should NOT be anonymous. However, confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference,<span><span><span>&nbsp;with the exception of title and author information which will be published on the website prior to the conference.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><br>
</span></span></p>
<div>
<h3>Upon Acceptance of your CHI Workshop</h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Workshop organizers will&nbsp;be notified of acceptance or rejection by 21 November, 2014. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Authors of all accepted workshops&nbsp;will receive instructions on how to submit the publication-ready copy of their Extended Abstract.&nbsp;&nbsp;Publication-ready submissions are due on 9 January 2015. &nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h3><span><span>At the Conference</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>The workshop organizers are expected to facilitate discussion, help maintain productive interaction, and encourage participation. The emphasis should be on group discussion, rather than on presentation of individual position papers. Diversity of perspectives should be encouraged.</span></span></p>

</div>


<div>
<h3><span><span>After the Conference</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Accepted Workshop summaries will be distributed in the CHI Extended Abstracts, available on USB and in the ACM Digital Library.</span></span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>It is expected that workshop results will be communicated to a larger audience. We ask workshop organizers to produce a report for publication in the SIGCHI Bulletin or Interactions. We encourage additional avenues of communication, such as organizing an informal Special Interest Group (SIG) at the conference, preparing an edited book or special issues of journals following the conference, or maintaining a web site or email list to network with others who might be interested.</span></span></p>

</div>



<div>
<h3><span><span>Workshop Registration Fees for Organizers</span></span></h3>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span>The workshop registration fee will be waived for up to two workshop organizers, but all other organizers and participants who attend the workshop will need to pay the workshop participation fee. Workshop fees for participants in 2015 are expected to be similar to CHI 2014 fees . In addition to the workshop fees, all workshop attendees (including organizers whose workshop fee has been waved) are required to register for at least one day of the CHI conference.</span></span></p>
