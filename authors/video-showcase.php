<h3>Message from the Videos Chairs</h3>
<p>The videos showcase is a forum for human-computer interaction that leaps off the page: vision videos, reflective pieces, humor, novel interfaces, studies, and anything else that is a good match for video and relevant to HCI. Your work will be screened by a large CHI audience during a special session at CHI 2015, and will be considered for the Golden Mouse award. Because of the large audience the video showcase attracts, it is one of the best means for getting your message out to the CHI community. Videos will be available in the ACM Digital Library after the conference.</p>
<p>Work will be judged on how much it intellectually engages an HCI audience and how effectively it communicates its message. Ultimately, we are looking to put together an enjoyable show for the attendees. Interesting but poorly-produced videos will be rejected - but if it's YouTube-ready per se, it should be ready for the videos track!</p>
<p>Authors can submit videos of any length up to 5 minutes. Videos will be accepted in two categories: Full Videos and Short Videos. Full Videos will be given featured status at the event, will be considered for awards, and will be shown in their entirety. Short Video authors will be required to shorten their submissions to a maximum of 75 seconds to be shown at the event.</p>
<p>Videos will be accepted conditionally. The reviewing committee may ask you to shorten your video further, to improve edits, or otherwise to prepare it for public consumption. You will be given a short period of time to revise your video and re-submit a final version for approval and screening at the conference.</p>

<h3>Preparing and Submitting your Video Showcase Submission<br>
</h3>
<div><span>A Video Showcase submission <span>must be submitted via the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi" target="_blank">PCS Submission System</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 January 2015, 5:00pm PST. The proposal must have the following two components: </span></span><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<ol><li>
<div>Extended Abstract. A one-page&nbsp;description of your video submission submitted in&nbsp;the Conference <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/format#extendedformat">Extended Abstract Format</a>. <br>
<br>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Video Submission. Your video must adhere to the following guidelines:</div>
</li>
<ul><li>
<div>At most five minutes in length, noting that 2-3 minutes is a more common length. Contact the Videos chairsat least 12 hours before the submission deadline if you have good reason to request special exemption for the length limit.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Titles and credits totaling no more than ten seconds: showcase your content!</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Encoded as an MP4 using the H.264 codec. No exceptions!</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Resolution of at least 1280px x 720px. Send as high a resolution copy of your video as possible.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>We strongly recommend 16:9 aspect ratio. Encode your video using square pixels for the pixel aspect ratio to avoid your movie looking stretched when projected.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>At most 100 MB in file size (the system allows us to make a small number of exceptions to this rule, but please contact the Videos chairs in advance).</div>
</li></ul>
</ol>
<p>Most video editing software provides an exporting option to MP4/H.264, for example iMovie, Adobe Premiere, and Final Cut Pro. If you prefer to use free software, x264 can encode any video into H.264.</p>
<h4>Third-party material and copyright</h4>
<div>It is very important that you have the rights to use all the material that is contained in your submission, including music, video, images, etc. <strong>Attaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author</strong>, not the ACM or the CHI conference. You are encouraged to use Creative Commons content, for example music available at ccMixter. If you&nbsp;need to use copyrighted protected work, you are required to review and comply to <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy/" target="_blank">ACM's Copyright and Permission Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/third-party-material" target="_blank">ACM's Requirements about 3rd party material</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/what-is-copyright.html" target="_blank">YouTube's copyright education website</a> provides useful information on reusing 3rd party material.</div>
<p>Authors of accepted submissions must sign a copyright form allowing us (ACM and SIGCHI) to upload your video into the ACM Digital Library and YouTube or equivalent video-sharing sites as part of the CHI Video collection. As with standard procedures for other ACM publications, authors retain copyright of the material but accepted submissions will only be published or shown at the conference with a signed form permitting ACM to use the content.</p>
<h3>Video Showcase Selection Process </h3>
<p>Videos will be reviewed according to two main criteria:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Content:</strong>&nbsp;Is the material interesting to human-computer interaction researchers and professionals? The topic of the video is ultimately up to the athors, but some approaches that have worked well in the past include the following: presentations of research systems, visions of the future, humorous parodies or thoughtful critiques of SIGCHI and HCI, and reports on ethnographic work and user studies. A video's content evaluation depends on how directly it addresses issues of relevance to HCI, and whether its message is interesting and engaging.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Presentation:</strong>&nbsp;Is the video edited well? Does it make appropriate use of pacing, music, and special effects? Does it drag on, or will it hold an audience's attention? Because the video showcase is a live screening, we strongly encourage creative editing of your videos. The tight time limit is imposed to keep videos short and punchy. In addition to effective pacing, your video should include appropriate music or soundtrack. Your idea may be brilliant, but if you can't convey it in an engaging way, it will not make a good live video piece.</li></ul>
<div>Videos may show work that has been published or released previously. Please make clear in your submission any prior exposure your video has received.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><span>Submissions should not contain&nbsp;sensitive, private, or proprietary information that cannot be disclosed at publication time.&nbsp; <span>Submissions </span>should NOT be anonymous. However, confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference,<span><span><span>&nbsp;with the exception of title and author information which will be published on the website prior to the conference.
&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div>
<h3>Example Videos</h3>
<p>The following videos have won awards in previous years. We encourage you to use them as models for your own work. In addition to enjoying their contents, we encourage video producers to consider them from the point of view of production: their length, lighting, pacing, use of media assets (video, images, sound, and text), spatial and temporal compositing, and above all how these production and editing choices are used to tell a story to the CHI audience.</p>
