  <p>CHI 2013 introduced <strong>Video Previews</strong>, a new way to share research results with attendees and with members of the community who are not able to attend the conference. The goal was to help people plan their conference time, to help them discover interesting and important work, and to increase the visibility of presentations beyond the conference.</p>
  <p>CHI 2015 will continue the use of video previews. All authors of accepted Papers and Notes, as well as some extended abstract venues, will be required to submit a 30 seconds video which describes their work. The video previews will be made available through different mediums (e.g., Youtube channel) before and during the conference to help attendees plan their daily schedules. They will also be archived and embedded on the abstract page of the ACM Digital Library.</p>


  <h3>Deadline</h3>
  <p>The deadline for submitting your video preview is <strong>February 16th 2015</strong>.</p>
  <p>Video previews are required for the following venues.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Papers and Notes</li>
    <li>Extended Abstracts
      <ul>
        <li>Panels</li>
        <li>Case Studies</li>
        <li>Courses</li>
        <li>Interactivity</li>
        <li>alt.CHI</li>
        <li>SIGs</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>TOCHI</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The video previews will be released on April 15th, two weeks prior to the conference.</p>
