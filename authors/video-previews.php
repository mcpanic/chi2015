<p>
<strong>Video Previews</strong> are 30-second videos that can be thought of as an elevator pitch to give a glimpse of your work, and are here to help connect your work with the community at the conference and beyond. Since their introduction at CHI 2013, Video Previews have been adopted in world first class conferences such as ACM UIST and IEEE VIS. They provide the authors with a great opportunity to publicize their work to a wider audience and to attract more readers to their paper (*).
</p>

<p>
CHI 2015 will continue the use of video previews. All authors of accepted Papers and Notes, as well as some extended abstract venues, are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to submit a 30 seconds video that describes their work. The Video Previews will be made available through different mediums before and during the conference to help attendees plan their daily schedules (ACM YouTube Channel, conference program application, digital proceedings). They will also be archived and embedded on the abstract page of the ACM Digital Library.

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
<!--   <p>Authors of accepted Papers &amp; Notes and Extended Abstracts (Panels, Case Studies, Courses, Interactivity, alt.CHI and SIGs) are required to create a video or other animated presentation to complete their final submission. The video material must conform to the format as described in the submission guide below. We strongly recommend you to read the <a href="video-previews-details"> detailed guidelines </a> which list a series of technical as well as production recommendations to help you create a compelling video preview of quality. For inspiration, please also visit the <a href="http://inputdesignoutput.com/previewsgallery-2014/gallery.html" target="_blank"> Video Previews Gallery</a> featuring examples from previous years.</p> -->

    <ul>
    <li>The first <strong>3 seconds</strong> of the video must include the <strong>title of your paper, authors list, affiliations and contact information</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>The rest of the video should communicate <strong>the topic and the message</strong> of your work (like an elevator pitch)
    </li>
    <li><strong>The video must be appropriate</strong> in terms of rights, use of language, viewpoints or imagery, and should not offend any individuals or groups at the conference or elsewhere (we reserve the right to reject videos whose content is inappropriate).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Subtitles</strong> should be included to improve accessibility to your video (recommended)
    </li>
    <li><strong>No advertisement for the conference talk</strong>. Video Previews will be archived on the abstract page of the ACM Digital Library as a short video figure to overview your work. Their diffusion therefore goes beyond the conference and should not be seen as a teaser to the presentation. Instead, Video Previews should be thought of as a video abstract to attract more readers to the paper.
    </li>
    </ul>
