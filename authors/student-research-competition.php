<h3><a name="TOC-Message-from-the-Student-Game-Competition-Chairs"></a>Message from the Student Research Competition Chairs</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Student Research Competition (SRC) is a forum for undergraduate and graduate students to showcase their research, exchange ideas, and improve their communication skills while competing for prizes at CHI 2015. The CHI SRC competition is a branch of the </span><a href="http://www.acm.org/src"><span>ACM Student Research Competition</span></a><span> which hosts similar competitions at other ACM conferences.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Student Research Competition has the following goals:</span></p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>to give undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to share their research ideas and results at CHI in a special forum that provides visibility for their work</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>to give students the opportunity to meet with and interact with CHI attendees to share ideas, gain new insights, and understand possible practical applications</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>to give students an opportunity to sharpen their communication skills</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>to provide detailed feedback to students about their research and presentation, from a panel of distinguished judges from industry and academia</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>to recognize and reward outstanding student research</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Participants must be students pursuing an academic degree at the time of initial submission. The contest has two categories, one for undergraduate research and the other for graduate research. Three winners will be selected in each category. Research completed while the student was an undergraduate may be submitted to the undergraduate category even if the student is now a first-year graduate student.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Each competition entry must be authored by one student only - neither supervisors or other students are allowed as co-authors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For work accepted to the CHI 2015 Student Research Competition,</span><span> </span><span>a travel grant of up to US $500 will be awarded to help cover travel expenses to the conference. While the student must be an ACM member to qualify for travel funding and awards, she/he does not need to be one to submit to the competition.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top three winners at CHI 2015 in each category (undergraduate and graduate) will receive prizes of US $500, US $300, and US $200, respectively. All winners will receive a medal and two-year complimentary ACM membership with a subscription to ACM's Digital Library. Winners will be recognized during the closing plenary session of the CHI 2015 conference. The first-place winners will also go on to compete in the </span><a href="http://www.acm.org/src/subpages/participate.html"><span>ACM grand finals</span></a><span> with winners from other ACM conferences.</span></p>

<h3><span>Preparing and Submitting your Student Research Competition Submission</span></h3>
<span>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Student Research Competition submissions must be submitted via the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi" target="_blank">PCS Submission System</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 January 2015, 5:00pm PST. The submission must have&nbsp;the following three components:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol><li>
<div><span><span>Extended Abstract.&nbsp; <span>Students should submit a&nbsp;non-anonymized paper (6 pages maximum) written in the <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/format#extendedformat"><span>Extended Abstract Format</span></a></span><span>. Submissions not meeting the page limit or formatting requirements will be automatically disqualified. </span><span>The student competing in the research competition must be the primary contributor of the work. Supervisors or other students may not be co-authors of the paper.<br>
<br>
</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span><span><span>Poster. poster design should be reduced to one standard letter page in size and submitted in PDF format.<br>
<br>
</span></span></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span><span><span>Proof <span>of Student Status: submit </span><span>a note signed by your academic supervisor</span><span> verifying </span><span>all</span><span> of the following information:</span>
<ul><li>
<p><span>your university</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>whether you were a graduate or undergraduate when the work was done</span></p>
</li>
<li><span>proof confirming that you are currently registered in an academic program full-time: Participants must be students pursuing an academic degree at the time of initial submission.</span></li></ul>
</span></span></span></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Your&nbsp;submission to the Student Research Competition should describe recently completed or ongoing student research in any of the topic areas covered by CHI. Even if the research was completed under the supervision of a supervisor, the submission must be authored by the graduate student alone (no co-authors - even other graduate students - are allowed). For undergraduate students, a group of undergraduate students who worked together on a project can submit the research with all their names on it, but all students must be undergraduates and the faculty advisor cannot be listed as an author. Submissions should be original work that is neither in submission elsewhere nor already published in CHI or another conference or journal.</p>
</span>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Papers should describe:</span></p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>The research problem and motivation for the work</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Background and related work</span></p>
</li>

<h3><span><span>Student Research Competition Selection Process</span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Student Research Competition is a </span><a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/call-for-participation#juried"><span>juried</span></a><span> track for CHI 2015. Juried content is reviewed by a jury of experts that will evaluate the work based on its overall quality, originality, and relevance to the CHI community. While not considered archival, Student Research Competition extended abstracts will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. Publishing in the Student Research Competition will not constrain future submissions as your abstract and poster are not considered to be a prior publication of the work for the purposes of a future CHI Paper or CHI Note or for a journal publication.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Submissions will be evaluated based on:</span></p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Quality of work</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Novelty of approach</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Significance of the contribution to the field of HCI</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Clarity of written presentation</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Visual presentation (poster)</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Submissions should not contain&nbsp;sensitive, private, or proprietary information that cannot be disclosed at publication time.&nbsp; <span>Submissions </span>should NOT be anonymous. However, confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference,<span><span><span>&nbsp;with the exception of title and author information which will be published on the website prior to the conference.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Up to twenty-five students in total will be chosen to participate in the competition at CHI 2015.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Submissions not accepted for the Student Research Competition may be invited to be part of the Works-in-Progress track.</span></p>
<h3><span>Upon Acceptance of your Student Research Competition</span></h3>
<span><span>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Student Research Competition authors will&nbsp;be notified of acceptance or rejection by&nbsp;26 January, 2015.<br>
 </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Authors of all accepted submissions will receive instructions on how to submit the publication-ready copy of their Extended Abstract.&nbsp;&nbsp;Publication-ready submissions are due on&nbsp;2 January 2015. <br>
<br>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">A travel grant covering expenses for travel to CHI, including conference registration, transportation, lodging, and meals, up to a limit of US $500 will be provided to each student whose submission was accepted to the Student Research Competition. Students must be members of ACM to qualify for these awards.</p>
</span></span>
<h3><span><span>At the Conference</span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The first round of the competition evaluates the research during a poster presentation at CHI. The presentation will be evaluated on two dimensions, given equal weight: (1) the presentation of the research, including visual aspects of the poster and the student's verbal discussion, and (2) the research, specifically its quality, novelty, and significance of the contribution.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Based on the results from the poster session, the judges will select students to advance to the second round. During the second round, students will have the opportunity to give a short presentation of their research (10 minutes) followed by a question and answer period (5 minutes), which will be evaluated by a panel of judges. Winners will be announced during the closing plenary.</span></span></p>

<h3><span>Competition Judges</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>TBD</span></span></p>
<h3><span><span>After the Conference</span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The first-place winners from each category will advance to the </span><a href="http://www.acm.org/src/index.html"><span>ACM Grand Finals of the Student Research Competition</span></a><span> where the winners of several ACM conferences compete for more prizes and recognition.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Accepted Student Research Competition Papers will be distributed in the CHI Conference Extended Abstracts, available on USB and in the ACM Digital Library.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
