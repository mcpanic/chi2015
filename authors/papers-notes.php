<h3 >Message from the CHI Papers &amp; Notes Chairs</h3>
<p >CHI Papers and Notes are refereed publications of original research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). CHI Papers and Notes are read and cited worldwide. They have broad impact on the development of HCI theory, method and practice. Papers present significant contributions to research and practice in all aspects of Human Computer Interaction. Notes present brief and focused research contributions that are noteworthy.&nbsp;<a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/papers-versus-notes" >Papers versus Notes: What is the difference?</a></p>
<p >Authors must present accepted Papers and Notes at the CHI Conference. Accepted manuscripts appear in the ACM CHI Proceedings of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which is listed in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<h3 >Preparing and Submitting Your Paper or Note</h3>
<ol ><li><strong>The CHI program committee consists of subcommittees that each focus on a subset of topics in human-computer interaction. The author decides which subcommittee reviews his or her paper.</strong>&nbsp;The CHI program committee is divided into topical subcommittees to help handle the over 1,900 Papers and Notes submissions and provide high-quality reviews by experts. When you submit a paper, you will state which subcommittee you want to handle your submission. You will see a list of subcommittees and descriptions of the topics they cover, the names of the Subcommittee Chairs, and the names of the Associate Chairs serving on each subcommittee. Using all of this information, it is your responsibility to select the subcommittee that offers the best expertise to assess your research, and that you believe will most fully appreciate your (main) contribution to the field of HCI. If you are unsure, you can email the subcommittee chairs for advice. As an author, this empowers you to choose the appropriate audience to review your research.

<li><strong>Papers and Notes are handled by the same program committee.</strong>&nbsp;Finally, you will indicate whether your submission is a Paper or a Note. All submissions will be handled by the same program committee, but the committee will have different expectations for Papers and Notes. See&nbsp;<a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/papers-versus-notes" >Papers versus Notes: What is the difference?</a></li>

<li>
<strong>Familiarize Yourself with <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/sigchi-submitter-agreement">the SIGCHI Submitter Agreement</a>.</strong> New this year, when you submit your work, you will be asked to agree to the terms and conditions of <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/sigchi-submitter-agreement">the SIGCHI Submitter Agreement</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>Write and Format Your Anonymized Paper or Note.</strong>&nbsp;Your submission must be original. It cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. A Paper is no more than 10 pages long, while a Note is no more than 4 pages long. This includes figures, references, appendices and an abstract of less than 150 words long. Over length submissions will be rejected. See

<li><strong>Prepare Video Figure&nbsp;<i>(Optional)</i>.</strong>&nbsp;Your submission may be accompanied by a short digital video figure or interactive illustration. Supplementary video figures do not have a specified limit for duration, although we recommend staying within 5 minutes. However, your total submission size (paper + video) must be no more than 100 MB. Since not everyone who reads the Paper or Notes may view the video figure, your submission must stand on its own without the figure, and will be reviewed as such. See&nbsp;<a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/guide-to-submitting-a-video-as-supplementary-material"  title="Guide to Submitting a Video as Supplementary Material">Guide to Submitting a Video as Supplementary Material</a></li>

<li><strong>Make Your Submission.</strong>&nbsp;Authors may submit and resubmit their materials to the online&nbsp;<a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi"  target="_blank">PCS submission system</a>&nbsp;as often as they please before the submission deadline of 22 September 2014. This includes descriptive information (meta-data) you provide during the upload process (e.g., keywords and the subcommittee that will handle your submission) as well as the abstract, your submission, and (optional) video figure. No extensions will be granted after the deadline. The submission system will open for submissions approximately two weeks before the submission deadline.</li>

<h3 >CHI Paper and Notes Review Process</h3>
<p >Papers and Notes undergo a rigorous review process, managed by the Papers &amp; Notes chairs and several subcommittees, each comprising a coordinator and associate chairs. Authors will be provided with preliminary reviews and can respond with a rebuttal. Confidentiality of submissions is maintained during the review process. See&nbsp;<a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/chi-papers-and-notes-review-process" >CHI Papers and Notes Review Process</a></p>
<h3 >Interactivity for Papers and Notes</h3>
<p>
We strongly encourage authors of Papers and Notes submissions to also participate in <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/interactivity">Interactivity</a>. This is most applicable to Papers or Notes that describe novel interactive technologies or interactive experiences. Interactivity for Papers and Notes allows authors to present a hands-on demonstration of their research in a high-visibility, high-impact forum. Authors of Papers and Notes who wish to participate in Interactivity are required to prepare a separate non-anonymised submission for the Interactivity track. There will be no formal association between submissions and their associated Paper or Note, and these submissions will go through the same reviewing process as standalone submissions. The content of the submission can be adapted from the existing Paper or Note submission. In the event that your Paper or Note is not accepted, you will have the opportunity to also withdraw your Interactivity submission, but you must do so by 22 December 2014. Please refer to the Interactivity for Papers and Notes section in the <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/interactivity">Interactivity</a> call for participation for more details.
</p>

<h3 >Upon Acceptance of Your Paper or Note</h3>
<p >Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection on or before December 15, 2014. Contact authors of conditionally accepted Papers and Notes will receive instructions on how to prepare and submit the final version of the paper. A member of the program subcommittee will check that the resubmission meets the committee requirements for publication and, if so, will finalize the acceptance. Authors are encouraged to submit their revision earlier than the deadline in case it is judged that the paper does not meet the committee requirements. If the authors are unable to meet these requirements by the provided deadline then the Papers Chairs will notified and may be required to drop the paper from the program. Authors of accepted papers will be required to submit a thirty word statement of contribution and benefit. They will also be asked to submit a thirty second video preview summarising the paper. Please note that submissions will not be published without a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, or by paying an upfront fee to ACM for Open Access. Obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the CHI conference.</p>
<h3 >Your Paper or Note at the Conference</h3>
<p >Authors are required to present their work in a scheduled session with other CHI Papers and CHI Notes. Paper authors will be allowed 20 minutes total (about a 15 minute talk with 5 minutes of questions) to present their work. Notes authors will be allowed 10 minutes (about an 8-minute talk with 2 minutes of questions) to present their work. Papers whose authors are not at the conference to present their paper may be removed from the DL.</p>
<p >Presenting at CHI describes the computing and audiovisual (A/V) equipment provided by the conference, and gives tips on preparing and giving a good CHI talk.</p>
<h3 >Your Paper or Note after the Conference</h3>
<p >Accepted Papers and Notes will be distributed in the CHI Conference Proceedings available on DVD and in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide. Video figures of accepted Papers and Notes will be archived on the Conference DVD and the ACM Digital Library.</p>
<p >Accepted Papers and Notes may come from any arena of HCI activity: academia or business; science, engineering, or craft; analysis or design. Acceptance is highly competitive: all accepted Papers and Notes will score highly on innovation, contribution and quality of thought and writing. Submit your best work!</p>
