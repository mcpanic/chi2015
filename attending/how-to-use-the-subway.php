<h3>Subway Fare</h3>

<div>
  <h4>Subway Fare System</h4>

  <p>
    The Metro transit fare is set to a distance scale that unifies all of the metropolitan subway sections (based on the shortest traveling distance).
  </p>

  <table class="table" style="width: 100%">
    <thead style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center">
      <tr>
        <td>Classification</td>

  <h4>Transfer</h4>

  <p>
    When passengers transfer from a subway to a bus or a local bus, the transit fare is computed according to the combined distance scale rate system in which all sections or zones that have been traversed are added together. (Instead of paying a separate fare upon transferring, passengers are charged an extra fare for the additional distance they have traveled beyond their fare zone.)
  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold">
  Note: The basic fare applies to a travelled distance of up to 10km. Beyond this point passengers will be charged an extra fare for every 5km traveled.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Regardless of the transportation mode and the number of transfers during a trip (a maximum of five transfers is allowed per passenger per trip), the basic transit fare applies as long as the traveled distance is within the minimum traveling distance of 10km (can transfer for free). (Basic fare of 1700 won up to 30km for Seoul Metropolitan, Incheon Metropolitan Express and Gyeonggi Direct Express Buses; Basic fare of 1500 won for Gyeonggi Express Buses.)
      </li>
      <li>
        If the combined traveled distance, on all modes of transportation, is beyond the minimum traveling distance, passengers will be charged an extra fare of 100 won for every 5km traveled.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the combined unified fare exceeds the sum of the unified fare for each mode of transportation used, the final fare will equal the aggregate of the fares charged on each mode of transportation.
      </li>
    </ul>
