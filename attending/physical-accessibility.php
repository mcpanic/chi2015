<div>
  <p>
    CHI is committed to being a conference open
    and welcoming to academics, researchers, and practitioners with disabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of our effort to ensure access for all, CHI 2015 collects accessibility
    needs as part of the conference registration process. Individuals who
    self-identify as having physical accessibility-related needs are
    contacted by the conference management team prior to arrival at CHI,
    to discuss any arrangements or services that are required.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have already registered for CHI 2015 but are concerned that
    we may not be aware of your physical accessibility-related needs,
    please email the CHI conference office (<a href="mailto:chi@gomeeting.com">chi@gomeeting.com</a>)
    at your earliest convenience. The CHI conference office, located in room ### at the
    Coex Convention and Exhibition Center, will be happy to assist in locating any resources
    that CHI attendees may require during their time in Seoul.
