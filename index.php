            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>For over 30 years, the CHI conference (pronounced ‘kai’) has attracted the world’s leading researchers and practitioners in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) from businesses and universities to share ground-breaking research and innovations related to how humans interact with digital technologies.  The Association for Computing Machinery’s (ACM) CHI conference is the world's premiere conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, presenting a highly selective showcase of the very best advances across the disciplines of computer science, cognitive psychology, design, social science, human factors, artificial intelligence, graphics, visualization, multi-media design and other disciplines.</p>
            <p>
            The theme for CHI 2015 is "Crossings": crossing borders,  crossing boundaries, crossing disciplines, crossing people and technology, crossing past and future, crossing physical and digital, crossing art and science, … crossing you and me.
            </p>
            <p>
            Cross into new territory by joining us in Seoul, Korea, one of the world’s most dynamic cities and the center of emerging trends in culture, technology and design.  For those who create and evaluate new systems, CHI 2015 will be a central cross-point to find the latest in research and design of the world’s most innovative technologies.
