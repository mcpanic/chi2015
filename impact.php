            <h2>HCI's Impact on Industry</h2>

<p>
    HCI’s impact on the technology industry has been enormous.  Since the 1970’s, leading companies have increased their success through the growing use of HCI methods to (1) avoid wasting precious investment money from failed deployments of inferior technologies and to (2) generate new revenue by identifying under-served needs and then to envision, design and test innovative products and services that fulfill the under-served needs effectively. 
    HCI specialists employ a variety of techniques to determine whether products are learnable, usable, and valuable.  Through rigorous beginning-to-end methods that combine concept design, design critique, cognitive analysis, performance experiments and more, HCI researchers assess whether technologies frustrate, thwart, and confound people rather than serve, engage and extend people’s capabilities.

    In addition to tremendous cost savings, the field of HCI has spawned billions of dollars of innovative product and service categories.  Early examples of the business value of HCI methods include Xerox’s employment of cognitive psychologists, social scientists and engineers to develop copier interfaces, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and the development of the world’s first commercial mouse and personal computer.  HCI researchers at Xerox PARC, Olivetti and other corporations also envisioned and captured fundamental patents, designs and prototypes in the field of Ubiquitous Computing that completely anticipated the current age of network services, interactive displays, tablets and smart phones.   Since those early HCI-generated product categories, dozens of others have been presaged at CHI prior to market deployment including multi-touch and 3D interaction, tangible interfaces, social networking, instant text messaging, personal health and elder care, fitness tracking, smart homes, internet of things, human-robot interaction and wearable devices.  The CHI conference is often the first public demonstration of such advanced technologies.

<p>
    As a concrete example of the bottom-line value of HCI, consider the recent US court decision that did not recognize infringement of 3 technology-based patents, but awarded more than a billion US dollars for the infringement of 7 patents related to design and interaction1.  Whether or not the decision changes after appeal, there can be no question that the HCI-related intellectual property created tremendous business advantage.

<p>
    The 2013 CHI conference, held in Paris France, attracted more than 3,400 thought leaders from the top technology companies and research institutes around the world and we expect to see continued growth in attendance at CHI 2014 in Toronto and CHI 2015 in Seoul.  Top corporations ranging from processor manufacturers (Intel), operating system vendors (Microsoft), laptop and tablet computer manufacturers (Dell, Hewlett Packard), web service providers (Google, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon), mobile computer manufacturers (Samsung, Apple), telecommunication carriers (Verizon, NTT Docomo), automobile manufacturers (Ford, Audi) as well as emerging companies and startups send employees to the CHI conference to present and hear the world’s most advanced innovations. Please join us in Seoul Korea for CHI 2015 to cross boundaries and connect to the future.
