  <h3 id="recruiting-booth">Recruiting Booth</h3>
  <p>For more information on renting a recruiting booth, see the CHI 2015 Invitation to Exhibit (coming in September), or contact Carol Klyver at <a href="mailto:recruiters@chi2015.acm.org">recruiters@chi2015.acm.org</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="recruiting-boards">Recruiting Boards</h3>
  <p>If a recruiting booth is more than you need, renting a "recruiting board" where you can post open positions may be a good option. You may also supplement a recruiting booth rental with a recruiting board to enhance your efforts. More information on recruiting board rentals may be found in the CHI 2015 Invitation to Exhibit, or by contacting Carol Klyver at <a href="mailto:recruiters@chi2015.acm.org">recruiters@chi2015.acm.org</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="sponsoring-opportunities">Sponsoring Opportunities</h3>
  <p>Recruiting efforts are further enhanced by becoming a conference sponsor. For more detailed information about this and the many other advantages of sponsoring, please <a href="<?php echo $prefix; ?>/sponsoring">click here</a> or contact Carol Klyver, Sponsor and Exhibit Coordinator, at <a href="mailto:recruiters@chi2015.acm.org">recruiters@chi2015.acm.org</a>.</p>
